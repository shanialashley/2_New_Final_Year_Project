# Final_Year_Project-Movie_Tickets_Now

This app was build on Android Studio 4.1.1, therefore, it may not build with some of the older versions of android.

In order to test the QRC Scanner in the application, your emulator must edit it to allow the webcam to be used as the camera for the emulator.

Also for the testing of uploading the thumbnails and cover images on the Admin UI, you would need to have your google drive signed in as well as ensuring the photo gallery is already signed in to the google account so you would get an easy transition when saving your tickets.
